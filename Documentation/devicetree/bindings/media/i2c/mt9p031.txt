* Aptina 1/2.5-Inch 5Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Aptina MT9P031 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 2592H x 1944V. It is programmable through a simple
two-wire serial interface.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be either one among the following
	(a) "aptina,mt9p001" for MT9P001 color sensor
	(b) "aptina,mt9p001m" for MT9P001 monochrome sensor
	(c) "aptina,mt9p006" for MT9P006 color sensor
	(d) "aptina,mt9p006m" for MT9P006 monochrome sensor
	(e) "aptina,mt9p031" for MT9P031 color sensor
	(f) "aptina,mt9p031m" for MT9P031 monochrome sensor

- input-clock-frequency: Input clock frequency.

- pixel-clock-frequency: Pixel clock frequency.

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: Chip reset GPIO

Example:

	i2c0@1c22000 {
		...
		...
		mt9p031@5d {
			compatible = "aptina,mt9p031";
			reg = <0x5d>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpio3 30 0>;

			port {
				mt9p031_1: endpoint {
					input-clock-frequency = <6000000>;
					pixel-clock-frequency = <96000000>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
