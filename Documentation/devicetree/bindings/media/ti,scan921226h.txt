TI SCAN921226H Video Deserializer
---------------------------------

The SCAN921226H receives a LVDS serial data stream with embedded clock and
converts it to a 10-bit wide parallel data bus and recovers parallel clock.
Some CMOS sensors such as the ON Semiconductor MT9V024 produce a LVDS signal
compatible with this deserializer.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "ti,scan921226h"
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells: should be <0>
- port@0: serial (LVDS) input
- port@1: parallel output

The device node should contain two 'port' child nodes (one each for input and
output), in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Optional Properties:
- enable-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the REN (output enable) pin,
  if any.
- npwrdn-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the nPWRDN pin, if any.

Optionally, #address-cells, #size-cells, and port nodes can be grouped under a
ports node as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Example:

      csi0_deserializer: csi0_deserializer {
              compatible = "ti,scan921226h";

              enable-gpios = <&gpio5 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
              npwrdn-gpios = <&gpio1 24 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

              #address-cells = <1>;
              #size-cells = <0>;

              /* serial sink interface */
              port@0 {
                      reg = <0>;

                      des0_in: endpoint {
                              remote-endpoint = <&mt9v024_0_out>;
                      };
              };

              /* parallel source interface */
              port@1 {
                      reg = <1>;

                      des0_out: endpoint {
                              remote-endpoint = <&ipu1_csi0_mux_from_parallel_sensor>;
                              bus-width = <8>;
                              hsync-active = <1>;
                              vsync-active = <1>;
                      };
              };
      };
