config TRUSTED_KEYS_DEVELOPMENT_IMPORT

        help
          This option adds support for creating new trusted keys from
          existing key material supplied by userspace, instead of using
          random numbers. Once defined,  as with random trusted keys,
          userspace cannot extract the plain-text key material again
          and will only ever see encrypted blobs.

          This option should *only* be enabled for debugging/development.
          Also, consider using 'keyctl padd' instead of 'keyctl add' to
          avoid exposing the plain-text key on the process command line.

          If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.
